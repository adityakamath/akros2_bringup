# akros2_bringup
ROS2 package to bringup the AKROS2 robot

* Configures and launches the [ldlidar](https://github.com/linorobot/ldlidar) package. 
* Configures and launches the [realsense-ros](https://github.com/adityakamath/realsense-ros/tree/ros2) launch file for the T265 Tracking Camera. The T265 can be turned off using a launch argument ```t265```. Note that an older branch of the realsense-ros package is used, at the time of writing this, the newer branches don't seem to support the T265 camera.
* Configures and launches the [akros2_drive](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_drive) launch file. This launches the PS4 controller nodes, the Twist related nodes and the micro-ROS agent.
* Launches [rosboard](https://github.com/adityakamath/rosboard) and/or [rosbridge_server](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/tree/ros2/rosbridge_server) based on launch arguments ```viz_rosboard``` and ```viz_foxglove``` respectively. ROSBridge is used to connect to [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/docs/studio/connection/rosbridge). Note that a personal fork of the rosboard package is used, with only the port number changed to 8000 instead of 8888, because 8888 is used by Jupyterlab in my environment. Uses [rosbridge_server_launch.py](https://github.com/adityakamath/akros2_bringup/blob/galactic/launch/rosbridge_server_launch.py), which had to be rewritten as the rosbridge_server package offers only an XML launch file, which currently cannot be launched from within a python launch file ([answers.ros.org](https://answers.ros.org/question/405921/ros2-including-xml-launch-files-in-a-python-launch-file/)).
